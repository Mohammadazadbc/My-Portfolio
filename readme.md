[Check My Portfolio](https://azad-portfolio-pro.netlify.app/)

This is my old portfolio built with React and Node.js. I copied the design and rebuilt it following a tutorial from JavaScript Mastery. It is a truly amazing project, though it holds more significance in terms of learning rather than the satisfaction of using my creativity to construct a remarkable piece of work. This realization prompted me to start building my new portfolio, relying on my imagination and drawing inspiration from various aspects of life.
